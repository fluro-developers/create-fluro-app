2. You’ll need to have Node >= 8.10 and npm >= 5.6 on your machine.

npx on the first line is not a typo — it’s a package runner tool that comes with npm 5.2+.


## Getting Started
Create Fluro App is a comfortable environment for learning Fluro, and is the best way to start building a new single-page application to deploy on Fluro.

It sets up your development environment so that you can use the latest JavaScript features, provides a nice developer experience, and optimizes your app for production. 
To register your new application, run:

```bash
npx create-fluro-app
```
